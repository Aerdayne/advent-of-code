# Advent of Code

A repository with my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

Some of them are written with speed and performance in mind (<i>I wish</i>), others are written in Ruby.

The initial plan was to switch languages every day in order to get out of the comfort zone and learn new things, thus if you see `Ruby >90%` in the 'Languages' tab to the right it means that I have successfully failed in this endeavour.

Almost all of the solutions were revisited and polished after the submission, but the algorithms themselves remain true to their original versions that I have come up with at 7 AM. Some of them are not optimal and for some no second thought was given (<i>*cough* binary in day 5 *cough*</i>).
